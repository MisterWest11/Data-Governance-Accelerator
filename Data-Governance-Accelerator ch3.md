# Identofying roles of data.

Data's Ubiquity: Data is present and utilized across various functions within an organization, not limited to specific departments like data analytics or IT.

Importance of Data Quality, Security, and Accessibility: For data to deliver its full value, it must be accurate, secure, and readily available to authorized personnel when needed.

Data Empowers Everyone: Data is not just a tool for leaders and decision-makers; it has the potential to benefit everyone within an organization.

In essence, the passage highlights data as a fundamental element for every organization. Effective data management practices that ensure quality, security, and accessibility are crucial to unlock the potential of data and empower all levels of an organization to make informed decisions and achieve success.

**Operations**

Core Business Operations: Every organization has a set of essential functions to keep things running smoothly, such as payroll, order management, and marketing. These specific needs may vary depending on the business type.

Data as the Power Source: Business operations rely heavily on various data sources and information for smooth functioning.

Data Creation and Consumption: Operations not only utilize data but also generate a significant amount of data through their activities.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Operational performance can be effectively measured and quantified using data. This data empowers informed decision-making within functions like HR (e.g., analyzing hiring times or offer acceptance rates).

Data as a Byproduct: Activities within operational functions naturally create data. For instance, in HR, candidate applications, applicant evaluations, and system logs all generate data.

Data for Internal and External Use: Data from operations is used for internal purposes (e.g., regional sales teams reporting to headquarters) and potentially shared with external entities.

Automation in Data Operations: Many data-related tasks within operations are automated. For example, inventory systems may automatically trigger reorders when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.

Data Expertise in Operations: As evident throughout various operational functions, skilled personnel, established processes, and dedicated technologies are often involved in handling operational data.

In essence, data serves as the fuel that keeps business operations running efficiently. It empowers informed decision-making, automates tasks, and provides valuable insights into operational performance. Businesses leverage skilled personnel, processes, and technologies to manage and utilize data effectively within their operational functions.

**Decision-making**

Data-Driven Decisions: The Highest Value: In the realm of business, the ability to make informed decisions based on data is considered the most valuable outcome of data utilization.

Unprecedented Access to Data: Today, organizations have access to a vast amount of data and information, both internally generated and readily available from external sources.

Democratization of Data Analysis: The rise of user-friendly data analysis tools empowers more people to access and gain insights from data.

Impact on Consumer Decisions: Search engines like Google and Bing have transformed how consumers, including patients researching their health concerns, approach decision-making. This can have both positive and negative consequences, with some patients coming to appointments with inaccurate information.

Data for Faster and Better Business Decisions: Within organizations, abundant data facilitates quicker, more timely, and higher-quality business decisions. Executives can gain real-time insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) compared to traditional methods with delayed reporting cycles. Even interim data provides a significant advantage over operating in the dark.

Quality Data Matters: While data-driven decision-making is crucial, the quality of the data is paramount. Outdated or inaccurate data (bad data) can be detrimental, potentially leading to poor decisions that range from minor mistakes to business closure.

In essence, data empowers informed decision-making, a core competency for businesses today. However, the quality and timeliness of data are critical factors. Organizations need to ensure they have access to reliable and up-to-date data to maximize the value derived from data-driven decision-making.
