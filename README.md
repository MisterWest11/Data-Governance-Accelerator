# Chapter 1: Defining Data Governance

***Understanding Data Governance***

**What is meant by governance.**

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated and enforced. 

When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent. 

It is a system of rules and controls applied to a specific area. Data governance refers to methods and practices for managing data to get the most value out of it while minimizing the risks. Its importance is that it is growing as the amount of data organizations handle keeps increasing.

 **What is data governance?**

 Different departments in a company rely on data for various purposes: staff need quick access to high-quality data, leaders need data for informed decisions, legal needs data to comply with regulations, etc.
 
To ensure everyone gets the data they need and to minimize risks associated with data, organizations need data governance.

Data governance goes beyond just managing data. Well-managed data can drive innovation, growth, and better decision-making throughout the company, leading to a data-driven culture.

Well managed data can be transformational and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made up using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers. Research confirms that most business leaders today want their organizations to be data-driven, but according to a survey by New Vantage Partners, only 32% are achieving that goal.


Data governance also helps minimize data risks and ensure compliance with regulations.

Many businesses manage data but lack data governance, which means they don't treat data as a valuable asset. Data governance helps turn data into a strategic asset for the company.


Broadly, the discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of value of its information assets. a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record is called enterprise information management (EIM).

Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

**Data Governance vs Data Management**

*Data Governance*

  * Focus: defines "what" & "why" of data handling.

  * Components: Roles, responsibilities, policies, data definitions, metrics and data lifecycle management.

  * Analogy: Its like the company's constitution, setting rules and principles for data handling.

*Data Management*

  * Focus: Implements the "how" of data handling as defined by data governance.

  * Components: Technical aspects like database, data warehouse/lakes, APIs, analytics, software, data security(encryption), processing tools and designing/implementing data architecture

  * Analogy: it's like the company's engineering tea, responsible for building the actual data infrastructure.

in summary, Data governance sets the direction and Data governance executes the plan.

**Data Governance vs Information Governance**

*Data governance*

  * Focus: Deals with data itself, independent of its meaning.

  * Example: Securing patient data and staff data using the same policies and processes, even though the data is different.

  * Analogy: Focuses on the building blocks(data) without necessarily considering the bigger picture of what they build(information).

**Information Governance**

  * Focus: Concerned with the meaning of data and its context within the organization.

  * Example: Understanding how  patient data and staff data relate to each other to improve healthcare delivery.

  * Analogy: it focuses on the structure and how the building blocks(data) come together to create a meaningful structure(information).

*key points*

There's an overlap between the two. 

Data governance professionals should understand both data and information governance for a well-rounded approach.

**The value of Data Governance**

some main advantanges achieved by good data governance include: 

  * improved data quality.

  * Expanded data value.

  * Increased data compliance.

  * Improved data-driven decisions making.

  * Enhanced business performance.

  * Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally.

  * Increased data availability and accessibility.

  * Improved data search.

  * Reduced risks from data-related issues.

  * Reduced data management costs.

  * Established rules for handling data.


Data is becoming more important for business. More businesses recognize data as a critical asset.

Data governance helps organizations get the most out of their data. It establishes processes and policies to ensure data quality, reduce risks, and make data-driven decisions.

Benefits of data governance include: improved data quality, increased data value, better compliance, improved decision-making, better business performance, increased data sharing, and reduced costs.

Without data governance, organizations struggle to achieve these benefits and may suffer negative consequences such as poor decision-making due to inaccurate data.

Data governance is a conscious choice that requires investment. It's not something that happens automatically.
