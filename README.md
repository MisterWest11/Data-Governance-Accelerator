Data is one of the most important resource an organization possesses in today's economy.

Data Governance is critical for businesses to manage their data effectively and avoid risks. The course aims to teach you about data governance in a clear and simple way.

# Chapter 1: Defining Data Governance

***Understanding Data Governance***

**What is meant by governance.**

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated and enforced. 

When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent. 

It is a system of rules and controls applied to a specific area. Data governance refers to methods and practices for managing data to get the most value out of it while minimizing the risks. Its importance is that it is growing as the amount of data organizations handle keeps increasing.

 **What is data governance?**

 Different departments in a company rely on data for various purposes: staff need quick access to high-quality data, leaders need data for informed decisions, legal needs data to comply with regulations, etc.
 
To ensure everyone gets the data they need and to minimize risks associated with data, organizations need data governance.

Data governance goes beyond just managing data. Well-managed data can drive innovation, growth, and better decision-making throughout the company, leading to a data-driven culture.

Well managed data can be transformational and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made up using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers. Research confirms that most business leaders today want their organizations to be data-driven, but according to a survey by New Vantage Partners, only 32% are achieving that goal.


Data governance also helps minimize data risks and ensure compliance with regulations.

Many businesses manage data but lack data governance, which means they don't treat data as a valuable asset. Data governance helps turn data into a strategic asset for the company.


Broadly, the discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of value of its information assets. a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record is called enterprise information management (EIM).

Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

**Data Governance vs Data Management**

*Data Governance*

  * Focus: defines "what" & "why" of data handling.

  * Components: Roles, responsibilities, policies, data definitions, metrics and data lifecycle management.

  * Analogy: Its like the company's constitution, setting rules and principles for data handling.

*Data Management*

  * Focus: Implements the "how" of data handling as defined by data governance.

  * Components: Technical aspects like database, data warehouse/lakes, APIs, analytics, software, data security(encryption), processing tools and designing/implementing data architecture

  * Analogy: it's like the company's engineering tea, responsible for building the actual data infrastructure.

in summary, Data governance sets the direction and Data governance executes the plan.

**Data Governance vs Information Governance**

*Data governance*

  * Focus: Deals with data itself, independent of its meaning.

  * Example: Securing patient data and staff data using the same policies and processes, even though the data is different.

  * Analogy: Focuses on the building blocks(data) without necessarily considering the bigger picture of what they build(information).

**Information Governance**

  * Focus: Concerned with the meaning of data and its context within the organization.

  * Example: Understanding how  patient data and staff data relate to each other to improve healthcare delivery.

  * Analogy: it focuses on the structure and how the building blocks(data) come together to create a meaningful structure(information).

*key points*

There's an overlap between the two. 

Data governance professionals should understand both data and information governance for a well-rounded approach.

**The value of Data Governance**

some main advantanges achieved by good data governance include: 

  * improved data quality.

  * Expanded data value.

  * Increased data compliance.

  * Improved data-driven decisions making.

  * Enhanced business performance.

  * Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally.

  * Increased data availability and accessibility.

  * Improved data search.

  * Reduced risks from data-related issues.

  * Reduced data management costs.

  * Established rules for handling data.


Data is becoming more important for business. More businesses recognize data as a critical asset.

Data governance helps organizations get the most out of their data. It establishes processes and policies to ensure data quality, reduce risks, and make data-driven decisions.

Benefits of data governance include: improved data quality, increased data value, better compliance, improved decision-making, better business performance, increased data sharing, and reduced costs.

Without data governance, organizations struggle to achieve these benefits and may suffer negative consequences such as poor decision-making due to inaccurate data.

Data governance is a conscious choice that requires investment. It's not something that happens automatically.

**Creating a Data Governance Program**

The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following:

 1. defining the vision, goals, benefits.

 2. Analyzing the current state of data governane and management.

 3. Developing a proposal based on the first 2 steps, including a draft plan.

 4. Achieving leadership approval.

 5. Designing and developing the program.

 6. Implementng the program.

 7. Monitoring and measuring performance.

 8. Maintaining the program.


Data governance is a process for managing data to get the most value out of it while minimizng the risks.

Its becoming increasingly important as business rely more on data.

Benefits of data governance include improved data quality, better decision-making and increased compliance.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to data governance, but there are common elements like data quality, security and availability.

Data governance is a complex but important topic for organizations that want to get the most out of their data.

In summary, data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization. It’s safe to say that for a growing number of organizations, data governance is becoming a very big deal.

**Developing a Data Governance Program**

data governance programs should be customized based on am organization's needs and reseources.

A well-designed data governance framework is essential for implementing a program.

There are many data governance frameworks available, but they all share common components focusing on people, processes and technology.

Know these common components and how to implement a basic data governance framework.

These are the most important qualities of a data governance framework:

* *Leadership and Strategy* - Ensuring senior leadership support and aligning data governance efforts with the vision, mission, and strategy of the organzation.

* *Roles & Responsibilities* - Identifying and empowering the right team members with responsibilites for the data governance program and others with accountability for data.

* *Policies, Processes, & Standards* - Developing and enforcing the policies, processes and standards for governing and managing data.

* *Metric* - Measuring and reporting on the performance of data governance program and the broader outcomes of data management services.

**Leadership & Strategy**

Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation and operational efficiencies. You must ensure these aspects and goals ahave a clear alignment of data governance.

Alignment with organizational strategy is crucial - the program's goals shloud support how data is used to achieve the organization's broader goals(e.g. risk management, growth)

Leadersip buy-in is essential - without support from senior leaders, the program is unlikely to succeed.

**Roles & Responsibilities**

Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities which range from the IT team to data stewards.

Data relies on assigningthe right roles and responsibilities to ensure the program's success. These roles typically span various departments within an organization, including IT.

**Policies, Processes and Standards**

In data governance,policies, processes and standards help guide the responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed and deployed. Depending on the size and complecity of the organization this can take signficant effort.

Policies, Processes and Standards: these are core elements that define responsibilities and ensure consistency across the organization. They need to be designed, developed and implemented. There must be clear mechanisms for holding people accountale and enforcing them.

**Metrics**

The program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support which includes funding. You'll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise program.

Metrics are essential for measuring success and maintaining support: The program should have a way to track whether it's achieving its goals. This data is important for demonstrating the program's value to stakeholders and securing continued funding. Based on the metrics, you can make adjustments to the program to ensure it delivers the desired results.

**Tools**

Include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.

Data science related tools have become more user-friendly and automated in recent years. This makes data management more accessible and empowers more team members to effectively handle data and extract value from it.

**Communications & Collaboration**

Effective communication is critical due to ongoing changes and requirements. This can involve various methods like meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.

Change management is crucial to ensure impacted team members understand how the program affects them and their responsibilities.

Collaboration is essential for success. Different stakeholders need to work together. A positive culture that rewards teamwork and clear communication channels (meetings, online platforms) are essential for effective collaboration.
