# Chapter 2

In this chapter, we will be:
  * Defining data and its relationship to information.

  * Exploring the role of data in the 21st century.

  * Moving from data to insights.

  * Discovering the impact of big data.

We will indulge in the challenges of managing data abundance in organizations. Unlike traditional resource constraints(budget, time), organizations struggle with an *abundance of data*. This creates challenges in managing, protecting and utilizng this data effectively.

The vast amount of data, also known as big data, comes from various sources like daily operations, products, customers, and partners.

Effective data governance and management are crucial to unlock the potential of big data and improve organizational performance.

**Big Data**

Data has a specific meaning and its really important to be clear on the definition, particularly as we start talking about information, knowledge and insights. But its even more important as we consider data in the context of governance and management. Data governance is not the same as data management.

People often take the meaning of "data" for granted and might have different interpretations. This can lead to misunderstandings when requesting or providing data.

Data is distinct from information, knowledge, and insights. A clear definition helps avoid confusion between these related concepts.

Precise understanding of "data" is crucial of data governance, a process concerned with managing and protecting data effectively.

**Why all the focus on data?**

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. 

Single units of data are traditionally referref to as *datum* and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and in this course.

Prior to proccessing, data doesn't need to make sense individually or even in combination with other data. Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically at a high level, it falls into of the following categories:

  * Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure. Each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. Its ready for analysis. e.g. first name, last name, phone number...

  * Unstructured: Data that stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. e.g. email content and social media posts.

  * Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

This basic action of data processing cannot be overstated, as it represents the core foundation of an industry that has ushered in our current period of rapid digital transformation. Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).

**Welcome to The Zettabyte Era**

A zettabyte is a unit of digitally storage that measures an incredibly large amount of data. 

* Zettabyte Era: The rapid growth of data creation led to the use of zettabytes to quantify this massive data volume.

* A Huge Number: One zettabyte is equal to 1021 bytes or a 1 followed by 21 zeros.

* Rapid Data Growth: By 2020, 64 zettabytes of data were created globally, and this number is expected to keep growing exponentially.

* Comparison: To store one zettabyte, you would need one billion terabyte drives.

* Technical Breakdown: A zettabyte is made up of bytes, and each byte consists of 8 bits. A bit is the fundamental unit of data storage on a computer and can be either a 0 or 1 (binary system).

* Future Units: As data volume keeps increasing, even larger units like yottabyte and brontobyte might be needed.

A zettabyte is an incredibly large number, equal to 1021 bytes (1 followed by 21 zeros).

By 2020, the world had already created 64 zettabytes of data, and this amount is expected to keep growing rapidly.

The term "datasphere" refers to all this data.To store one zettabyte, you'd need one billion terabyte drives.

The passage also briefly explains bits and bytes, the building blocks of digital data. Zettabytes are even larger units, and we might need new terms like yottabyte and brontobyte in the future.

Managing a small amount of data can have challenges, but managing data at scale is materially more challenging.

**From Data to Insight**

Creating, collecting and storing data is a waste of time and money if its being done without a clear purposes or intent to use it in the future. Certain exceptions may be logical to collect data even  when we dont have a reason because it may have value at some point in the future, but this is only an exception. Generally, an organization is onboarding because its required for some purpose.

Data is raw, unprocessed elements.

Information adds context to the data.

Knowledge incorporates additional information and understanding.

Wisdom applies reasoning and experience to knowledge, providing a deeper understanding.

Insight uses wisdom to make a decision or take action.

every day, different organizations with access to the same data have different outcomes. While the best outcome can't be guaranteed no matter which processes, tools or skills are used, good practices such as the right level of data governance can absolutely lead to better results.

**The Role of Data in the 21st Century**

Historically, data has always been valuable for understanding the world, making informed decisions, and solving problems.

Since the mid-20th century, the role of data has grown significantly due to:

  * Increased quantity of data with the rise of computer systems.

  * Improved data quality and wider accessibility, particularly after the internet's arrival in the mid-1990s.


Today, we generate massive amounts of high-quality data that is transforming various aspects of our lives, including:

  * Industries and cities (tools and capabilities)

  * Learning

  * Socializing

  * Entertainment

    
The immense value of data also creates new risks, such as cyberattacks with potentially devastating consequences.

The author argues that data might be the most valuable asset in the world, signifying a new era for data and its impact on our careers.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making**

Data empowers better decision-making. Reading online reviews is a simple example of this concept in action.

Data-driven decisions can range from simple choices (like picking a restaurant) to complex strategic choices (like entering a new market).

Good quality data is crucial for effective decision-making. Using bad data can lead to poor choices and negative consequences.

The abundance of data we have today is a feature of the 21st century, but ensuring data quality requires specific actions and data governance plays a central role in achieving this.

**Data as The New Oil**

* Data is like oil in the sense that it fuels the digital economies of the 21st century, just as oil powered industrial economies in the past.

* Both data and oil are valuable but require processing to be useful. Oil needs refining, and data needs organization and analysis to extract insights.

* Major tech companies like Facebook and Google are the big players in the data economy, similar to how oil companies dominated in the past.

* Other industries are also leveraging data to transform their operations and generate revenue.

* The analogy extends to the issue of control. Just like control over oil granted immense power, companies with vast amounts of valuable data hold significant influence.

* The passage concludes by mentioning potential risks associated with a few big players controlling personal data.

**Data Ownership**

Data ownership refers to the rights and control a person, team, or organization has over specific data sets. This control can range from basic oversight to strict legal regulations. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

Accountability: Similar to assigning responsibility in projects, data ownership ensures someone is accountable for managing a data set.

Spectrum of Control: The level of control can vary. Data ownership might involve basic oversight or enforce strict rules regarding data access and usage.

Example: Data related to intellectual property (copyrights, trade secrets) will likely have strong ownership controls, including limitations on who can access it and how it can be used.
