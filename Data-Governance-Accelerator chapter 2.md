# Chapter 2

In this chapter, we will be:
  * Defining data and its relationship to information.

  * Exploring the role of data in the 21st century.

  * Moving from data to insights.

  * Discovering the impact of big data.

We will indulge in the challenges of managing data abundance in organizations. Unlike traditional resource constraints(budget, time), organizations struggle with an *abundance of data*. This creates challenges in managing, protecting and utilizng this data effectively.

The vast amount of data, also known as big data, comes from various sources like daily operations, products, customers, and partners.

Effective data governance and management are crucial to unlock the potential of big data and improve organizational performance.

**Big Data**

Data has a specific meaning and its really important to be clear on the definition, particularly as we start talking about information, knowledge and insights. But its even more important as we consider data in the context of governance and management. Data governance is not the same as data management.

People often take the meaning of "data" for granted and might have different interpretations. This can lead to misunderstandings when requesting or providing data.

Data is distinct from information, knowledge, and insights. A clear definition helps avoid confusion between these related concepts.

Precise understanding of "data" is crucial of data governance, a process concerned with managing and protecting data effectively.

**Why all the focus on data?**

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. 

Single units of data are traditionally referref to as *datum* and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and in this course.

Prior to proccessing, data doesn't need to make sense individually or even in combination with other data. Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically at a high level, it falls into of the following categories:

  * Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure. Each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. Its ready for analysis. e.g. first name, last name, phone number...

  * Unstructured: Data that stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. e.g. email content and social media posts.

  * Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

This basic action of data processing cannot be overstated, as it represents the core foundation of an industry that has ushered in our current period of rapid digital transformation. Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).
